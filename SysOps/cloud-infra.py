2. Cloud and Infrastructure Automation
Use boto3 to:
- List EC2 instances by tag and state.
- Start/stop instances on schedule.
- Fetch S3 bucket details and automate backups to S3.
- Write a wrapper script that automates AWS CLI tasks (e.g., upload logs, rotate credentials).
- Build a lightweight cloud resource auditor to check unused resources (simulated if no AWS access).
