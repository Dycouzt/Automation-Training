3. CI/CD and Container Automation
- Automate a Docker image build and push to registry using Python.
- Write a script to scan Dockerfiles for insecure instructions (e.g., latest tags, root user).
- Parse Jenkins or GitHub Actions build logs to extract metrics (success/failure counts, duration).
- Implement a Git repo monitor that detects new commits and triggers custom actions.
